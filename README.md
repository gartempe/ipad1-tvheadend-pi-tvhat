Repurpose the old Ipad 1st Gen as a TV viewer, thanks to Tvheadend and Pi TVHAT

**Limitations**
Ipad 1st Gen is stuck on IOS 5.1

**Good point**
- Hardware decoder for H264 videos.
- Quicktime player can play MPEG-TS stream encoded with H264 (video) + AAC (audio)
- Nice screen *(while limited resolution)*
